# HW_10_Template_Engine_Employee_Summary
This tool allows a company to list and nicely display their employees on a webpage. Using prompts in the terminal, a manager, engineer, or intern can be added to the team. For all of the employees, their name, email, and ID is required; each subclass of employee has at least one unique detail as well (i.e. the terminal prompts for the engineer's GitHub username and the intern's school). This could be a very useful app when it comes to a company's organization.
